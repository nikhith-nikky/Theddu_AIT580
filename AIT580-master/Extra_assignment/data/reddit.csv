wtfdc01,3i4tqq,81,Can we get rid of racist restaurant [daily grill dc] bullshit in this city?,"met up with my friends at the daily grill for lunch. None of us were drunk, we ordered food and drink and we were watching the nationals game and having our food when the manager came and out physically grabbed my friend (black) and told him that it was illegal to use a vape in dc. My friend agreed not to use it and put it away, but said that it was not illegal. The manager told him that if he caused any other problems he'd have him arrested. There were multiple people vaping at the time in an otherwise empty restaurant. 

I know this sounds like the stereotypical one sided story but we literally did not do anything wrong. No loud talking, no vulgar language, no back talk to the manager. We're all in our late 30s and are not a rowdy crowd. I was thinking that it couldn't possibly be this overtly racist. 20 minutes later, two cops show up and tell my friend he has to leave. They told us (all white including his wife) we could stay. 

The bartender was horrified when we all got up and left. The whole thing was caught on multiple phones and I was very proud of my city as multiple people spoke up and told us that they'd never come back when we were talking to the cops outside of the daily grill. 

It was 7 hours ago, and I'm still mad enough about it to be writing this. Can we please stop this shit?

TL;DR mutiple people using vapes at a bar. The only one to be thrown out with police escort was the black guy. Can we get rid of this type of shit?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3i4tqq/can_we_get_rid_of_racist_restaurant_daily_grill/,washingtondc,1440400241,/r/washingtondc/comments/3i4tqq/can_we_get_rid_of_racist_restaurant_daily_grill/,24-08-2015 03:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3i4tqq/can_we_get_rid_of_racist_restaurant_daily_grill/

r3droosterf,10m8l2,72,I just need to rant about Metro...,"I realize I'm participating in the daily circlejerk against Metro with my rant here, but I just need to know WHY is it that so-called ""track work"" and downed escalators and inefficient trains and neglectful workers are acceptable as the status quo around. 

In the Hong Kong or Japanese rails, if there's a problem then they'd send out an entire fucking army of engineers and repair workers on the scene and have it ready within a couple hours. Here, an escalator can stay downed for weeks on end without any explanation or timetable given. My own conspiracy-minded paranoia tells me that this status quo is kept in place because it's an opportunity to retain permanent job security for many of the locals here, who just happen to be either poor, lazy, uneducated, inefficient or some combination of that. This is done without any regard for the needs of the customers but simply to secure and maintain a jobs program for the DC underclass. I just have an incredibly hard time believing that it takes weeks to fix a goddamned escalator.

99.9% of all the bitching against Metro would be fixed if they just provided the simplest things to the customer to get them from point A to point B: 1) run trains on every line every 5 minutes 24/7 and 2) fix the escalators. That's it.  That's all everyone really wants. 

I don't get why in almost every other industrialized country there there are trains driven automatically, on time and on schedule, running almost every goddamned minute. Here, you'd be lucky to catch one on a Friday/Saturday night when most people in this town go out. This is supposed to be a major American city and yet on any given night of the week I have to deal with my shitty options:

-  WALK: through a dangerous/ghetto area to get to my spot or to go home
-  WAIT: 10-25 minutes for a train 
- DRIVE: around like an idiot looking for non-existent street parking with unintelligible signs or pay $30 for courtesy parking
- CALL: a cab that possibly won't take me to my neighborhood when I want to go home.

dafper,1numb4,82,Serious question. How do I meet single guys in DC?,"Single woman here, early 20s. This is what my habitat/schedule looks like:

Weekdays: 9-5 job downtown (all male coworkers are married), go home to my apartment in another part of DC, pick up some groceries, cook and eat dinner by self

Weekends: volunteer at a museum (although not right now, obviously), volunteer at another charity that I love but that have almost 100% female volunteers, go to Meetup events if I have time (about 2-4 times a month).

I'm kind of frustrated by the small number of single, dateable men that I currently have the opportunity to meet. Yeah, I've been asked out by a couple of men I've met through Meetup events, but they just weren't what I was looking for at all. (For example, I'm 5'8 and don't date shorter guys. I don't date religious people. I don't date people over 30. The list goes on.)

I even signed up for OKCupid for a short period of time and was disturbed by the number of messages I got from men of ALL races that read ""heyyy gurl are you Asian? What part of Asia are you from? Are you Korean?"" The only indicator that I had up on my profile of me being Asian was my profile picture. So it really made me uncomfortable, and I deleted my profile, and I don't want to try online dating again.

,5prutb,22,Disappointed the thread on the riots was locked...,"...because there's a lot more to say about what took place. Regardless of what you think of the rioters, the fact is that their presence on Friday was not a surprise. First of all, ""black bloc"" is not a group, it's a tactic. It's a tactic that's been used in DC before, it was used at Occupy, it's been used at BLM protests. And anybody with an Internet connection could see it would be used on Friday.

Let me be very clear. I do not support the rioters and I am not anti-police. My family are police. I respect the police. But what I saw on Friday as a citizen on the streets was completely ineffective police work that increased the danger for everyone - the public, the peaceful protesters, the rioters, Trump supporters, and yes, the cops themselves.

First of all, unless I am missing some crucial information (and I may be) the use of kettling on the northeast corner of 12th and L to arrest the group of ~100 people was completely unjustified.  I watched from the southeast corner as the police line took shape. There was a journalist in that group. There were innocent people who got swept up in the riot. Had I chosen to walk down 12th St instead of 13th St, I would have been in that group.

Let's be very clear about what happened -- everyone inside of that police barrier was arrested. That is the definition of an arrest. I know that windows were broken. I watched a rioter knock a motorcycle cop off of his or her motorcycle. I saw physical shoving and other contact between some rioters and cops. (It was also clear that it was a minority of this group were involved in these crimes.) But those transgressions do not justify indiscriminately arresting everyone unlucky enough to be at the corner of 12th and L. They simply don't. If there was a legitimate bomb threat, or something similarly extreme, maybe we'd have a different discussion. But AFAIK, there wasn't. There was property damage and light skirmishes with police, as there have been at every other black bloc riot in recent memory. I cannot stress enough how troubling it is that MPD used this as justification to arrest the ~100 people they managed to kettle.

But that was just the start.  That all took place around 11am.  For the next 5+ hours, the MPD maintained a militarized line, which moved sporadically from 13th and L to 13th and K, that was not a dousing, but a slow, steady pouring of gasoline onto an inflamed situation.

Let me repeat. I do not support the rioters. If you were out there, you probably saw me pleading with them to stop ripping the concrete slabs out of the sidewalk, to stop taking the bricks out of the median, and to stop burning trash and polluting our air.  But the MPD had a choice.  To RESPOND by promoting public safety and officer safety, and seeking to arrest the people suspected of committing a crime -- or to REACT by meeting disorganized force with greater, organized force.

If you were out there, then you saw a very clear divide.  The MPD line, with their riot gear, and then big crowds of hundreds of people on 13th St, on K St, milling around Franklin Square.  The police line invited conflict -- and the rioters responded by throwing whatever they could find.  And MPD fought back with stingray grenades, tear gas, and other devices that I don't know how to name.  But the problem is that this was not an organized crowd of rioters.  This was a busy intersection on an insanely busy day.  There were peaceful protesters marching through who did not realize what was going on.  There were Trump supporters returning from the parade who didn't know what was happening.  Same for curious bystanders, people in cars, and everyone else who was out on the street.  MANY of these people were tear-gassed, hit by MPD's rubber pellets, physically assaulted by the cops in the riot gear.  And for what? To what ends? The police tactics accomplished nothing. Their ""line"" created a flashpoint, it was a point of conflict, and they refused to back down from it.

Meanwhile, in the crowd of hundreds of people, there was not a single cop.  At least not one in uniform.  As the afternoon stretched on, there were no more than 100 rioters still engaging the police.  And I could have pointed out half of them.  Because I was in the crowd, watching them.  Why did the police not engage the crowd?  Why were there not units of 2-3 officers milling about the crowd?  If they had abandoned the ""line"" -- which was not protecting the parade, or inauguration, or anything beyond the other side of 13th Street -- and engaged the crowd, they could have arrested the troublemakers.  They could have prevented innocent bystanders from being hit by the police tear-gas, as well as the rioters' rocks (which didn't always make it to the police line).  They had the opportunity to engage the people on the street and protect everyone's safety -- instead they chose to engage in WWI trench warfare, fighting over a few yards of inconsequential pavement.

I will add that my experience with MPD away from this flashpoint was pretty decent.  But this squad of riot cops suffered from a remarkably self-defeating lack of leadership and failure of strategy.

I hope some of the MPD users can chime in and tell me why I'm wrong. I really do.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/5prutb/disappointed_the_thread_on_the_riots_was_locked/,washingtondc,1485236216,/r/washingtondc/comments/5prutb/disappointed_the_thread_on_the_riots_was_locked/,24-01-2017 00:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/5prutb/disappointed_the_thread_on_the_riots_was_locked/

eat_me_dc,51o2cu,14,Attn dog owners: Don't walk your dog off leash in Rock Creek Park,"If you have a dog, you might think it's a good idea to walk your dog off leash in Rock Creek Park. It's not. It's also illegal.

First, it's a danger to your dog. ""But my dog is well behaved, predictable, and listens to commands!"" you might say. Of course you would, because that's what the kind of narcissistic, self-centered asshole who walks their dog off leash thinks. But you see all those posters for lost dogs littering the edge of the park? That's what they all though too! 

Second, it's a danger to other dogs. Your dog comes bounding up the trail and runs at my on leash dog, my leashed dog is going to fuck it up. Some people call that leash aggression, and think it's unusual. I do have a rescue dog, but I call that common fucking sense. Think about what you would do if you were in handcuffs and some stranger ran out of the woods and jumped on you! Even the most friendly person would defend themselves tooth and fucking nail. 

Third, it makes a mess. I see your dog shitting in the woods. You just walk down the trail blithely like nothing is happening, but I'm sure you know it's shitting too. The park is big, but not that big, and you and your shitting dog are disgusting.

Fourth, it's illegal. Enough said.

""But I live in the city!"" you say. ""My dog needs the workout!""

Well your dog didn't choose to live in the city, you did fuckhead. Maybe you should have thought of that before you adopted a dog to share your studio apartment. That poor animal has no say in the matter, and if you had even the most minimal concern for it's welfare you would find it a better home.

Given the reasons above, I can only assume most of you walking your dogs off leash in the park are contemptuous pieces of shit who could care less about the health of your dog, the people around you, or the laws of the park. That said, in case of few of you are just idiots, now you know why you shouldn't be doing it.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/51o2cu/attn_dog_owners_dont_walk_your_dog_off_leash_in/,washingtondc,1473317031,/r/washingtondc/comments/51o2cu/attn_dog_owners_dont_walk_your_dog_off_leash_in/,08-09-2016 02:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/51o2cu/attn_dog_owners_dont_walk_your_dog_off_leash_in/

maustermuhle,3x8y0s,91,Why do Washingtonians feel the need to ask each other what they do for a living?,"Hey guys, Martin Austermuhle, a reporter from WAMU 88.5, here. 

I'm working on a quirky story for a new project we have called ""What's With Washington?"" (You can submit and vote on questions you'd like us to look into, and we'll pursue the most-voted questions.) Someone asked me a good question: Why do Washingtonians feel the need to ask each other what they do for a living?

So, I'm wondering a few things that I'd love to have input on:

1) Do people in Washington ask each other what they do for a living more than people in other cities? 
2) If you think they do, why? What is it about is that makes us jump to that question early in every conversation?
3) Is it a good thing, or bad?
4) What do people in other cities ask each other when they first meet?

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. It could be a pretty fun story on something that seems to be a very Washington thing to do.

dcretiree,5oe5eb,12,Hidden in a Washington Post Article is this about an Inaugural Event,"THIS NEEDS TO GO VIRAL

A long-standing tradition of the inaugural week is a nondenominational/nonsectarian service at Washington's National Cathedral. The service this year is again scheduled for the day after the inaugural. According to the Right Rev. Marianne Budde, Bishop of the Episcopal diocese of Washington, “Trump asked that there be no preaching during the interfaith service.""

Are there no bounds to the brazenness of this man? Four years ago the service was open to the public and I was privileged to find a seat. The highlight of a remarkable service was a sermon of the Rev. Adam Hamilton, a United Methodist minister. The sermon is printed at

IdontBleedIsparkle,bq6azp,44,Moving to Washington D.C. for 60k job,"Hello, I'm here seeking your advice. I 'm on the fence about accepting a 60k job a year in the Brentwood area of D.C. After doing some research I've discovered that that neighborhood is one of the most dangerous in D.C. I definitely do not want to live there.  I do have a car and wouldn't mind driving at least an hour and some minutes, but I would mind it if it involved super heavy traffic. Looking at it on Google Maps, and with my non-existing knowledge of the region, I assume the most direct  and less troublesome routes spring from Maryland, around Columbia. I've also seen lots of housing options in that area that would not leave a gigantic hole in my budget, as areas closer to work and in nicer neighborhoods would. I'm used to living by myself (don't like roommates, specially if they are strangers), don't care to live near crowds, clubs, bars and whatnot  (I prefer the peacefulness of nature), and I don't necessarily need a huge apartment, but I don't want a shoe box either. I also have a dog. It seems that this area fits all my requirements, but then again, these are my assumptions looking at it from Google Maps and doing internet research.

&#x200B;

I guess my questions would be, is there anybody here who lives around that region (Columbia, Bowie, Annapolis) that works in or has traveled to D.C. that can tell me how the commute is on average and whether it is doable? What other tips could you give? Maybe there are other places I don't know about that offer better commute and affordable, good quality housing?

beefcake_123,blgooc,9,"This weekend, I finally felt proud of being a DC resident for the first time.","This past weekend, I made a weekend trip to NYC to see some friends. Coincidentally, a friend from DC also happened to be in town as well so I decided to go hang out with her, her sister, and some of her sister's friends. 

My friend from DC is considering a move to NYC in the near future. While I would hate to lose her, she should do what she needs to do. 

My recollection is a bit fuzzy, but at some point, we were all having lunch together, and someone asked me if I was thinking about moving to NYC too, since my friend was thinking about moving to NYC. 

I replied ""no"". 

And the table gasped. ""Why not?"" a girl squealed. 

""Dude, you should move to New York. There's nothing going on in DC."" another man at the table said. 

I cleared my throat, mildly annoyed but still smiling. My chest was rising, I felt as if I was being implicitly criticized for not thinking about moving to flashy NYC and staying in boring, old Washington DC. 

""There's nothing for me, unfortunately, to justify moving here on a permanent basis. My life is in Washington right now. I do enjoy visiting NYC though!""

After I finished, I felt this great surge of pride of being one of the only two DC residents at the table. 

That seemed to placate the table and we moved onto other topics of discussion. 

But damn, do NYC transplants love to rep their city and tell you it's the best city to buy sliced bread in. I just found this so weird, but then again, NYC is a pretty unique city. Perhaps its always-on, work hard, play hard culture sort of rubs off on people by implying that it's also the best city in the world too (it's not, but NYC does have its charms). 

Still, I enjoy the slower pace in Washington, though. The people have less of an edge too them too. Plus free museums. 

Ironically it was when I wasn't in Washington that I felt proud to be ""from"" Washington. I didn't grow up in DMV, but it's home for me now.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/blgooc/this_weekend_i_finally_felt_proud_of_being_a_dc/,washingtondc,1557200682,/r/washingtondc/comments/blgooc/this_weekend_i_finally_felt_proud_of_being_a_dc/,06-05-2019 23:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/blgooc/this_weekend_i_finally_felt_proud_of_being_a_dc/

VandyGirl,1uvs0r,47,To the girls on the redline metro this morning: I'm sorry,"To the two college-age girls on the redline metro this morning travelling to Union Station (with 2 friends), I'm sorry.  

I'm sorry I - and everyone else on that train - just sat quietly and watched as that large, drunk man harassed you. I wanted to speak up, I tried staring him down, but he was unpredictable and unstable and I didn't know if we'd be able to get away if he turned violent.  

That's still not really an excuse, though. Because my silence - along with the silence of everyone else on the train - just reinforced the message that what he was doing was the norm - maybe even expected and acceptable. Women should just expect to be sexually harassed at any given moment and they just have to take it. That's not true, and I failed you both by not saying anything. You have a right to exist in a world where being female doesn't automatically mean being treated like an object.

I shared it with a bunch of my DC friends and got some pretty great responses.  And one of them recommend I post it here because they said it shared an important perspective (her words not mine). 

So I wanted to share the letter.  It's on my personal blog, so bare with me for the design and whatnot.  Important note: this is an attempt to drive traffic there.  I don't monetize it.   I just occasionally do some occasion personal thought posts there and share with my friends and family.

NateSilvermanDC,252kj7,6,"What I, Nate Silverman, would do if I saw the DC Red Line Masturbator","Julie Lessander splashed water on her face and sighed. Today was the big interview. She slowly put on her makeup; as always, the ritual calmed her down. When Julie got to her eyes she noticed that when the sunlight glinted off the mirror just so her eyes looked like God had taken azure chunks down from the stars and placed them in her irises. How could anyone say no to her?

She emerged out the door of her Mass Court apartment into a gorgeous DC day. She tossed her blonde her over her shoulder and concentrated on the task ahead. Her roommate, Sheryl, had gotten Julie into meditation. Julie hoped the Buddhist koans would calm her.

It wasn't that Julie minded being a waitress at Busboys and Poets. She just wanted to use her degree and her mind. Double major in economics and political science at University of Virginia. Cum Laude. It wasn't her fault that the economy sucked. But today is her shot--Booz Allen called two days ago. Julie took yesterday off to study the company as much as she could. 

Julie's mind kept on churning as she walked down into the Chinatown Metro. She was meeting her friend Steve for lunch in Dupont. A last meal before the reckoning. The Redline was mostly deserted. Around Metro Station she heard it. A constant 'shick-shick-shick' noise from behind her.

She turned and saw an ugly little gnomish man; his arm bobbed up and down over his lap with metronome like precision. She knew who this was. She gasped, ""The Redline Masturbator!"" 

He got up and started approaching her. The videos showed him run when confronted, but not now. Suddenly, the voice of an angel rang out, ""Leave the girl alone mister."" A few seats up another man was standing. This handsome man may look peaceful, but hell, doesn't Peter Parker look peaceful when he's out of costume? The hero approached the masturbator, but the wanton whack-offer pulled out a knife.

""Come get some you punk!"" shouted the villain.

The savior approached and put the man in an armbar. ""Krav Maga you bitch!"" He spun the masturbator around, pulled the knife away, and kicked him right in his tiny dick and balls. ""You won't be needed those where you are going.""

Julie swooned and thanked the man. ""What's your name?""

""Nate. Nate Silverman.""

She wrapped her long arms around him. The azure glinted as she looked up into his eyes. ""I think your name is my hero.""

""Where you going babe?""

""Lunch with a friend. Ugh, then an interview at Booz Allen. I'm kind of nervous.""

""Nervous? For Booz Allen? Babe, I'm the Deloitte Dandy. Ain't no one knows consulting like Natedogg.""

""Would you... teach me?""

""When's the interview?""

""Three hours.""

""Babe, I could teach a Border Collie how to do it in that time. I'm sure your brains match your beauty. How about you tell your friend that you met a new guy who is gonna land you the job?""

Julie blushed and the dichotomy of red and blue in her young, coltish face made Nate feel a spark he hadn't felt in a long time. ""Ok. Let me call Steve.""


-------------------------------
Julie got the job and called Nate to thank him. Nate asked her out to dinner the next night. The two may not have entered Graffiato hand in hand, but that is how they left. They complemented each other well and within six months they rented a place together in 360 H. The two lived it up, they were regulars at Little Miss Whiskey's Costume Karaoke and crushed Argonaut's science trivia every week. A year after that they were engaged. This time the engagement stuck. Soon after the wedding Julie became pregnant. The first time Nate held his daughter's hand he thought, ""If I hadn't been a hero on the Redline, none of this would've happened. None of it.""",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/252kj7/what_i_nate_silverman_would_do_if_i_saw_the_dc/,washingtondc,1399609770,/r/washingtondc/comments/252kj7/what_i_nate_silverman_would_do_if_i_saw_the_dc/,09-05-2014 00:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/252kj7/what_i_nate_silverman_would_do_if_i_saw_the_dc/

notjustanyschloss,14l1o1,12,WMATA is actively stealing money from its bus passengers,"Allow me to explain. Following is the text of an email I just wrote to Dr. Gridlock:

>Last week, I tried to use a RideOn monthly bus pass loaded on my SmarTrip card for the first time (this is the first month they offered this option, rather than a paper pass). I tapped my SmarTrip on the first bus, on Monday morning, and $1.60 was deducted from my account.

>I called the service center to request a refund. They told me that the bus would need to 'dock' in order to activate the pass, a process which would take up to 48 hours. They also refused my request, citing a policy to **not issue refunds for bus fare** (erroneously) deducted while a bus pass is pending.

>It turns out it took 96 hours for the above process to occur. From what I can tell, my bus pass didn't become active until Friday morning. Now I'm out $12.80 in bus fare -- more than 25% of the cost of the bus pass itself -- because something went wrong with the system, as I gathered from the service center agent I spoke to when I called back on Wednesday.

IANAL, but it seems to me like this no-refund policy is a back-door bus pass price hike, instituted without any form of public notice, let alone any opportunity for public comment.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/14l1o1/wmata_is_actively_stealing_money_from_its_bus/,washingtondc,1355139402,/r/washingtondc/comments/14l1o1/wmata_is_actively_stealing_money_from_its_bus/,10-12-2012 06:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/14l1o1/wmata_is_actively_stealing_money_from_its_bus/

Heyitsamethepizzaguy,dr84gc,120,Racial Microaggressions while walking at night?,"I recently moved here to the Georgetown neighborhood a few months ago to take a job at a tech firm. I'm a Black male and moved from a pretty racist mid-sized southern town where I was working with my family's business. Many still consider it a sundown town (not codified by law but police patrols were extremely aggressive towards people of color at night). Needless to say I wanted to get the heck out of there and have done so. I'm a night owl and love taking cities at night so it sucked living there. I take a walk pretty much every night of the week. On my walks I've experienced a lot of people crossing the street when they get close to me, rearranging bags to angle away from me, and women securing their purse's tightly as we pass each other on the sidewalk. I want to believe these were misunderstandings but it's been happening constantly since I've been here. At least one small incident a night, if not more.

The highlights of my walks have been a young woman literally brandishing self-defense spray in her hand as she approached me and two cops stopping to question me about why I was walking around so often (although they were pretty reasonable about it and didn't do anything crazy). Is this a common thing here? When I was weighing where to take a job my friends convinced me DC was extremely progressive when it came to things like race. My experience so far hasn't been like what I expected, so I just want to know if I should prepare myself for more. I'm making plans to explore other parts of the city after work with a couple friends.",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/dr84gc/racial_microaggressions_while_walking_at_night/,washingtondc,1572850036,/r/washingtondc/comments/dr84gc/racial_microaggressions_while_walking_at_night/,04-11-2019 01:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/dr84gc/racial_microaggressions_while_walking_at_night/

AnonDCThrowaway,8r87jh,24,BEWARE OF SCAMMER bouncing Checks in DC,"Throwaway account to keep anonymity.  In the first week of June, I was traveling downtown when I was stopped by an slim African-American gentleman covered in tattoos at the Capital One Bank located on 85 H St NW, 20001. He was in his early twenties. He had told me a fabricated story about how he had lost his wallet and needed to cash his check from his construction job in order to feed his starving family who were located in the car... A young woman of mixed heritage was seating in the front passenger seat alongside two preschoolers in the back that he claimed to be his children. Feeling sympathetic, I agreed to assist him. He handed me a check with the name ""Christopher Evens"" written on it. The check seemed legitimate so I deposited it in good faith. The check, obviously, didn't clear immediately and he said that it would clear in a few days. Seeming like an honest and genuine person in need, I believed him. I then proceeded to give him 600usd of my own money \[I know, stupid idea but I was vulnerable at the time\]. After the transaction had taken place, he took me into the Giant located on H st to deceive me into handing him the other 600usd by using cashback functionality 3 times \[200usd per usage\] and we went our separate ways, I checked my bank only to find out that the check took 10 days to clear rather than the typical 2-3 days. That's when I realized it was a fake check and that I had been scammed.  

During our small talk, I asked him what his passion was. He said he loved making music. He said he was a local DC artist. His stage name was SPADE. His instagram is theyoungest\_sugardaddy. Feeling violated, I decided to do some research. From his instagram, I was able to find everything about his personal life. 

His name is JURL REED. 

He is 24 years old. He is from the Glenarden MD area but comes to DC quite often to bounce checks with unsuspecting tourists and scatterbrained natives such as myself. I was able to find his police record and it turns out that he's been doing this since early 2017. Please help me spread awareness so that something like this can never happen to anyone ever again.

Even if you get me a higher paying job, I'll still give you the full 2-week pay, no matter what it is. **Initial contact by PM is preferred.** Obviously this isn't my main reddit account but I will be checking this throughout each day.

Looking for work near the DC area, ideally lab tech work with a biological lab at Georgetown or GWU, but open to other jobs that may be more appropriate or pay better.. Something relatively simple, contained within a 40-hour week where my work wouldn't need to come home with me. 

In particular, working for organizations such as Mental Health America, perhaps in an administrative role, would be a rewarding experience where I could contribute given my personal experience dealing with victims of mental disorders.

* Graduated this past May and have been caring for family at home for the past few months. Excited to get into the job market and pick up where I left off in the spring.

* My research experience at Duke didn't expose me to common lab techniques such as PCR, blotting, etc. - but I'm more than capable of learning quickly given my familiarity with lab protocol and daily routines as well as extensive animal husbandry and surgery prep.

ImpressiveRole1111,axlz95,55,My feelings on the metro DC housing market,"I recently moved to metro DC last year, and it feels like as a young professional the community isn’t really invested in my success.  From what I can tell there isn’t one community in the DMV that is building enough housing for population growth, and asking young people to be satisfied with the archaic and dilapidated housing supply is unacceptable.  Our nation should be able to do more than just keep the roof on units from 1945 in Arlington, which still cost a quarter of a million dollars for 300 square feet anyways.  Even a 325sqft rental near Grovensor metro costs about 1300 per month. Similarly, even if I wanted to move to downtown DC, my income tax would be 8.5 percent on all of my income over 60k.  


 am not a miser or a tax cheat, but that is punitive levels of taxation.  For those who grew up here or are in subsidized properties, they don’t face these problems.  The people who bought homes before housing prices doubled had no issues.  Meanwhile I would have to pay nearly 400k for what is effectively a shithole dilapidated 1950s home.  If I want to go downtown, my non metro accessible apartment means I would have to park (5.20 per day) then metro in, which is about 5 dollars each way.  On the whole, this results in about a 15 dollar bill just to take public transit downtown.  

I looked at moving downtown, but I am trying to pay off student loans and help my family back home financially, so I don’t have the privilege of living somewhere just for entertainment.  Last week I was downtown and I saw a girl in Starbucks organizing a trip to Guatemala to do charity work, meanwhile a homeless person in our country was looming over her, literally two feet away, and they were very obviously hungry.  I just don’t get why we aren’t building adequate housing.  I’ve entertained every crazy possible alternative, even living out of my car. 

It is just so frustrating that the system has been rigged against young people like me.  Half of my coworkers are from the area and live with their Auntie or their parents for free or nominal rent, meanwhile I toil, sell blood plasma, do my 9-5, and do postdates to try and get ahead.  Over time I will have enough money to either own property or have a more stable housing situation that has a greater sense of permanence, but that still won’t make it worth the effort I had to put into it to get this going.  

Metro DC housing is a scam perpetuated on young people.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/axlz95/my_feelings_on_the_metro_dc_housing_market/,washingtondc,1551826415,/r/washingtondc/comments/axlz95/my_feelings_on_the_metro_dc_housing_market/,05-03-2019 17:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/axlz95/my_feelings_on_the_metro_dc_housing_market/
edgarallanthrowaway,4cw3dx,16,Good places to do LSD,"Ideally:

* woody/natural area that doesn't require a long or tough hike

* not far from DC proper (so getting home won't be an ordeal)

My ideas so far:

* Roosevelt Island: I keep meaning to go, but I've yet to. Is it too small/crowded/densely populated on a nice day for us to be unencumberedly ourselves? If we stray from the trails, can we find a nice place to just sit and chill by ourselves?

* Rock Creek Park: Are their weekend planetarium programs too crowded or interactive? I think it'd be a fun/cheesy thing to do on the comedown if it's not a stressful experience

nipplezandtoez23,boz9gv,46,Making the most of two full days,"Hey fam,

I will be in DC for the first time with my husband soon. We will be there for two full days. Breakfasts aren’t planned (as of yet, anyway) - we mostly focused on lunch at dinner. 

Day 1: Arrive evening, dinner at Sushi Hachi

Day 2: Smithsonian and pop-up kitten lounge (yes).  Either Daikaya or China Chilcano for lunch. Kith and Kin for dinner. 

Day 3: White House tour, National Mall, Capitol Building Tour. Rasika for lunch. Hopefully Rose’s Luxury for dinner. 

Day 4: Leave after breakfast. 

It’s a short amount of time and there are so many other places we wanted to try: Bad Saint, Centrolina, Himitsu, Kinship, Tail Up Goat. Would you switch out any of our choices? Anything missing to help make the most of our time... other than more time?

lipby,2ciyl3,22,RANT: The federal workforce is broken,"I moved to DC in 2009 because my wife was offered a fun job and I ended up taking a job as a contractor at a federal agency in an IT setting.  Last week I learned that the project I am working on will soon be axed and our entire team is being laid off.

The truth is, when the big boss came to deliver the news to me I was actually relieved. Though the money has been good, I find the life of a subcontractor on a federal site dreadful. At least on our contract, the ever tanned and rested federal employees seem to regard their contractors as helots, objects of pity who, unlike them, still actually have to do work at work. 

I know one fed whose basic job seems to be putting phone meetings on mute while spending hours planning out his vacation schedule for the year--each category of leave is elaborately blocked out on a printed calendar--and creating PowerPoint booklets consisting of terrible poems that have phrases like ""nappy dugout"" in the titles. 

He also claims to be running a high-end brothel for visiting businessmen on the side, though I can't imagine him actually possessing the competence to run a small business. For this, he is paid well over $100,000 a year and has a guaranteed job for life. That is, as long as he can manage to put in eight hours a day and avoid looking at porn on his desktop.  

One thing some of the feds do enjoy is power that comes from delegation. One frequent tactic is to call a contractor two minutes before they’re scheduled to leave and ask them to come up and talk about some inconsequential issue. It is a way of letting the contractor know that you are under his control, that your fate is substantially tied to his or her whims.

My boss ended up working ten and eleven hour days because her federal counterpart managed to shift some of the few responsibilities he had onto her. Without fail he’d knock off at 4pm and enjoyed an “alternative work schedule” that requires him to actually only be in the office two days a week.  He literally knows nothing about the technology he is “managing.” My boss worked nights and weekends, made less money than he did, and had extensive knowledge in the industry. She'll be looking for a new job soon.  He'll continue knocking off at 4:00pm twice a week until he eases into retirement in another 15 years.

(This would be a good time to point out that many federal workers at my site are committed and passionate workers. But that commitment and passion seems to be innate to the individuals; if your goal is to coast for a few decades while waiting for retirement, the federal workplace is a wonderful place.)

A couple months ago I heard a report on NPR while driving in the car about a push from president Obama say to expand family leave.  His proposal was that he’d expand maternity and paternity leave for federal workers, letting this serve as a ""model"" for private industry. It will do no such thing. Private industry will continue clawing back on vacation time (as my company recently did) while federal workforce will continue to enjoy absurd worker protections and benefits. As I listened to the report I said to myself: ""Are they fucking serious? They want to make a federal gig an even sweeter deal?""

The best outcome would be that federal jobs become slightly more like private industry and private industry become slightly more like a federal job. I’ve noticed that the people most adamant about “family values” are the ones most likely to support legislation assuring the parents work constantly and mainly see their kids on weekends.  At the same time, the public service unions needs to be challenged so that the federal workforce can enjoy a modicum of efficiency.  

I don’t say this to be spiteful.  My wife is a federal worker and she quickly discovered that the “fun” job she had moved to DC for was actually a nest of dysfunction.  She left a small collegial organization for one rife with disaffected and unmanageable workers who are largely counting down the years to retirement.  

I don't know wht my next challenge will be, and I'm not sure in this town that I can avoid working as a contractor-serf. It's how this town is organized. I came from the nonprofit world in another city and would love to return to it, but this is an expensive town and I am at a time in my life when taking a vow of poverty on behalf of a noble cause is hard to sustain. But if I could find a nonprofit job supporting a worthy mission while making 70% of what I’ve been making, I’d be a happy man.  It has probably been sheer complacency that has kept me from finding this gig already. 

I have been a loyal Democrat for decades, but this experience had made me about 5% more Republican. When Republicans say that there is waste in the federal workforce, it was one of the few instances that they are not being utterly batshit insane. Surely, a town filled with so many smart people must be capable of finding a better way to organize government work…

This was not even on a surface street, in an area where there is no pedestrian traffic and no cross traffic.  I find the fine to be disproportionate to the infraction. 

So I know I have no choice but to pay it.  But if there was any type of organized movement against the District traffic cameras I would be interested in joining and supporting it. I believe there is a case against these traffic cameras because they do nothing to improve traffic safety, but instead are used as a revenue generator for the city. 

TL;dr - Yes, I'm bitter about getting a ticket. Yes, I'm going to pay it.  I'm hoping there's some way to affect a greater change because of it.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3mmt6e/is_there_any_organized_movement_against_dc/,washingtondc,1443425072,/r/washingtondc/comments/3mmt6e/is_there_any_organized_movement_against_dc/,28-09-2015 03:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3mmt6e/is_there_any_organized_movement_against_dc/

bchou15,chgj4o,17,Men's haircut,"Hi DC folks, I just moved into Columbia Heights and I need a haircut pretty soon, so I'm looking for recommendations for barbers/salons.

I have stiff, coarse hair that slightly resembles Justin Bieber's bowl cut from way back when (or think a thinner version of Topher Grace/Eric Forman's hair from That '70s Show if that helps), and I'm not one to be really experimental, so I don't need anything too fancy or complicated. I don't know if this helps, but I'm indeed Asian.

I've been a regular at classic barbershops and Korean salons in previous cities, so I'm fine with straightforward cuts running between $20-$40 before tips. I'd prefer places that I can easily walk-in (though I don't mind reserving) and that are near Columbia Heights or along the yellow/green metro line.

NateSilvermanDC,1lund4,10,Apology to the women of DC,"First off, I lost my password so this is my new account.

Secondly... and more importantly, I made a post that I realize in retrospect was not very kind of me:  http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1lrnfa/a_haiku_i_wrote_today_about_dc_girls_that_makes/

I'm sorry.

I am not a misogynist.  What happened to make this change in Nate is easy to explain.  


I have a friend named Benjy.  I met Benjy at Tryst one night.  I was reading ""The Art of War"" to get some hints on how to consult better.  I was just hanging out drinking some wine and eating some cheese.  Benjy approached and told me, ""hey I love that book!  Sun gets me in the mood to rise if you know what I mean""  He told me how it helps him get in the right mindset to ""sarge"" as he put it.  I didn't know what sarging was, but this was the gateway drug that led me into new worlds.


Benjy and I became quick friends.  He is one of my earliest and best friends in the District.  Recently I went through a break up; Benjy called me and said, ""Hey man, you finally ready to stop being a beta and alpha it up and go sarge?""  I thought that he meant play Halo or something.  Little did I know he meant The Game itself.


We went out to U St and hit on tons of girls.  I was bad at first.  He told me some good lines and things to do, like how to do palm readings and a routine or set about a fight outside and how girls I am talking to are too high class for that.  I felt like I was learning to golf from Vijay Singh or something.  I was watching a master at work.


Well, sadly folks, a change went over me.  At the end of the night I got what he said was a ""number close"" where I got a girls number.  Post breakup, my OKCupid account wasn't getting the replies I hoped it had.  I know I'm a nice guy and handsome and witty.  People at work like me, and I was raised with a keen comedic eye from years of Must See TV.  Hell, in college I wrote a script for a fictional Friends episode*.  But... my OKC account was in the doldrums :(. 

 

I texted the girl the next day and she didn't reply, I was a little upset and wondere why, so I asked my man Benjy.  He led me further down the rabbit hole.  Before you knew it, I was a disciple of Roosh V and Heartiste and all those DC pick up artists.  


In fact, Benjy is a tremendous writer and wants to make his own site.  People tell him he looks like Mark Whalberg and Benjy is fashionable, so he is gonna name his blog, ""Marky Mark and the Fucky Bunch"" and have lots of good PUA guest writers.


So here I was, reading Real Seduction blogs, really getting into it.  It reminded me of when I started playing Magic The Gathering and devoured everything I could to make the best elf deck.  


Well... I told my cousin Chas about my haiku and new found outlook.  He told me I was being a dick.  He asked me if I had gotten laid yet from it--I am man enough to admit I haven't, I did get a ""kiss close"" one night at the Jumbo Slice place next to Madam's Organ.  But no hook ups yet :(.


So Chas rung me out.  He told me I should go back to being me.  Who cares if those PUA guys think I am a ""beta male"".  


Chas is right.  If I meet a girl, and hopefully I do meet one of you through OKCupid or DC's fun night life :), I am doing it as me.  As Nate:  a funny, handsome, successful young guy with a shit ton to offer!


So I'm sorry folks :(.  The sexism is done for this man.

LutherLuffeigh,7byevd,12,Question for any left-wingers currently working for the federal gov't,"Hi /r/washingtondc,

I'm back with another job-related question. I'm being considered for a role with a government contracting firm that works with USCIS (US Citizenship & Immigration Services). The job is tech-related.

While I'm eager to get experience and the job appears to be well-paid and in a convenient location, I have some reservations about working for an agency that is carrying out the Trump vision on immigration. For example, I strongly, strongly disagree with revoking DACA and consider any and all versions of the travel ban to be abominations. 

I have already talked to my would-be boss about this and asked if he thought his firm was in any way being asked to carry out Trump's agenda. He assured me that his firm's work has not changed in any way shape or form since Trump took office. 

While that was reassuring, I still have some reservations about working for the federal government at this moment, specifically an agency that is now responsible for carrying out policies I strongly disagree with.

Just curious to hear if any other Redditors have dealt with similar concerns.

I confronted the driver with a ""what are you doing? stop your car!"" And she got all pissy and yelled something about ""driving in this city."" I then told her to ""learn to fucking drive"" which really pissed her off. She yelled some bullshit I couldn't hear and drove away.

mid30guy,2l9vyp,100,"Totally indecisive on career, feel stuck & behind others","Hi all,

I'm 34 now, and for a long time have felt that I've constantly been behind my peers. I know that life isn't a competition, and I'm doing well enough for myself, but a bunch of ""milestone"" parts of my life I feel are missing.

Given that DC is incredibly competitive and I imagine others are feeling this way, I was hoping I could get some insight from others that found their way.

About me:

- Age 34
- Live in NoVA
- Work in software product management as sort of middle management with focus on mobile apps
- Salary has been stuck in the low 100's
- Have a decent amount of savings/401k
- Single
- Currently renting, and feel disgusted that most of my friends can afford real estate while it would be tough for me.

**Basically at this point, I feel like I'm a generalist and stuck.**  I'm totally indecisive on what to do next, and don't feel like I have any really hardcore passion towards anything.

Some options I've been considering:

- Go for an MBA. Upside is prestige and ability to move up higher on corporate ladders. (Last title was director level). Downside is that any decent MBA program is $100k+. I wouldn't consider a non-top 15 program or so. Also, I feel that it's sort of a bullshit degree, and keeps me in a role as a bit of a generalist.  My company will NOT pay for it at the moment (though I could find someone that would).

- Do some kind of technical masters (finance? IT? other?). While I like working with software, I'd never want to work as a developer. I don't mind the idea of managing software teams at a higher level, though.

- Entrepreneurial route - my real dream is to travel and work on the road, but I'm not sure how to do this and have been indecisive for a decade on what to work on. I'm also getting older so my window of opportunity to do something like this is closing if I eventually get married or have kids

General interests: travel, health & nutrition, tech, mobile devices, style/clothing, learning & teaching, hiking, cycling, psychology & people

I feel like I've just kind of leveled out. I realize this is an expensive city with a lot of smart and successful people so it's harder to compare, but happiness is very much correlated to how you see yourself against your peer group.

Any thoughts on finding ways to be more decisive about career? Ways to feel happier and stop comparing myself to my friends?

In my brain I know that I'm doing just fine and should only compare myself against my own progress, but in my heart and gut I feel jealous and lost.

paolo001,doc3mu,12,Be careful banging on cars in the bike lane.,"First, this is not a criticism of the Secret Service (just doing their job) or the cyclist. It is just a funny story and another reason why I want to buy a front and rear traffic cam.

I was driving down 34th St this AM at about 7. The traffic was light approaching Georgetown and the two vehicles in front of me were two blacked out Suburbans with MD plates. The trail vehicle was driving offset from the lead vehicle and was blocking the bike lane on the right side of 34th St. (there were cars parked legally in spots to the right of the bike lane. Anyway, there was a vehicle in front of this package stopped at a stop sign allowing a pedestrian to cross when a cyclist legally approached from the rear in the bike lane approaching the intersection. He found the lane blocked and without looking attempted to edge around the package. There just was not room. When he touched the trail suburban on the rear quarter-panel the suburban flashed a light-bar that the cyclist could not see as he was trying to get around and looking down the side of the vehicle. For some reason he then got upset and slapped the side of the Suburban. The rear window rolled down and an agent in the back who was in a rear facing seat with something akin to an MP5 just looked at the cyclist when the cyclist poked his head around to work his bike back a bit. As soon as the cyclist realized what he was doing he waved at the officer and the officer acknowledged him. I think the cyclist actually chuckled and then the package drove through the intersection as two vehicles with their lights on. The cyclist stopped at the stop sign and then followed and did not attempt to pass until M St when the two vehicles turned towards the Key bridge and the cyclist turned left down M .

Long story short. Be careful banging on vehicle quarter panels no matter how in the right you think you are and remember that this is DC. Keep some semblance of situational awareness about you even on an early Monday morning.

Now I have to go order my front and rear camera system.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/doc3mu/be_careful_banging_on_cars_in_the_bike_lane/,washingtondc,1572312736,/r/washingtondc/comments/doc3mu/be_careful_banging_on_cars_in_the_bike_lane/,28-10-2019 21:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/doc3mu/be_careful_banging_on_cars_in_the_bike_lane/
rbrown91,d02nft,1,Almost accident,"This past weekend I witnessed what could’ve been an awful and tragic accident. Two kids (no older than 13, maybe) were riding their bikes. One of them decided not to wait for the pedestrian light to cross the street, his companion was yelling at him to stop and wait because it’s dangerous, all while the boy only pointed to the red light to his right to indicate that it was safe.

What he did not see, however, was that the light right on top of the walkway he was crossing was green, and the red light he was pointing to was for drivers not to turn left. So, while there could have been stopped cars to his left, the ones coming from the right did not need to stop. 

The girl behind him decided to follow him, but just as she was about to reach the middle of the walkway, something happened to her bike that made her stop and check the tire. At that exact moment, a car sped by. Didn’t even hesitate even though the girl was almost in the middle of the street (I’m not blaming the driver. The light was green and they did not need to stop). 

My husband and I were shocked because had the girl not stopped to look at the wheel, she would’ve most definitely been ran over by a car going at least 35 mph. Also, it had just rained, so even if the driver slammed on their brakes, it would have still been pretty bad. I’m not sure how much damage getting hit at that speed makes, but I can imagine is not something a Band-Aid can fix.

It ended on a funny note because the girl noticed the car and the boy was oblivious, and seeing her ripping him a new one was hilarious. “I’m telling mom! We could’ve died! The light was red! You’re SO DUMB!”

Just wanted to share an almost traumatic experience. Be careful out there and tell your kids to wait for the damned light!",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/d02nft/almost_accident/,washingtondc,1567727773,/r/washingtondc/comments/d02nft/almost_accident/,05-09-2019 19:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/d02nft/almost_accident/

norathar,br2jc3,4,Hotel Recommendations for First-Time Visitor?,"My parents are in their 60s and have never been to DC, but have always wanted to visit. I want to surprise them with a week-long trip this fall with the goal of doing the basic touristy things (hoping to do the National Zoo, Air & Space, National History, Natural History, the White House, the Capitol, and the Mall on a week's vacation, and maybe a couple other museums like the Newseum, Holocaust Museum, International Spy Museum if time.) I've already submitted the requests to my Congressperson for the tours, but the place where I'm getting caught up in trip planning is accommodations - I've never been to DC, so I don't know where would be best to stay, whether it's better to AirBNB/Vrbo or stay in a hotel, what neighborhoods I should avoid vs. which are any good. 

Does anyone have recommendations? I see a number of AirBNBs around Lincoln Park, the H Street Corridor, Mt. Pleasant areas, but I really have no idea which would be best, or if paying less and staying farther out is worth it - and I've looked online at different hotels, but again, I feel like I'm probably missing something reading reviews without asking anyone who knows the area. Any help or suggestions are definitely appreciated!

AutonomousHoag,bkp15f,12,Arlington / Rosslyn: Nice for a 1-month stay for work in May/June?,"Hi there! My wife and I will be in DC for about a month and we found a pretty nice place to stay in the Rosslyn area. While I know DC and Georgetown quite well, I don’t know this area. While my wife will mostly be working from the hotel, I’ll need to make quite a few trips into downtown, though not necessarily every day.

A few questions please:

1. Generally speaking, yay or nay to stay here?

2. Safe by day and night? And for my wife if she walks anywhere alone?

3. Metro access from Rosslyn seems easy enough while Georgetown is a 25 mins walk; anything else to consider?

4. Any nice areas along the Potomac to access for a nice run? Googling as I write this...

5. Seems like quite a few decent grocery stores (i.e., besides Safeway etc), cafes, restaurants; agreed?

6. Anything else we should know?

beefcake_123,9sumts,19,Should I move to DC from Boston? Did anyone here make the move from somewhere else and not know anyone? What was it like?,"Yesterday, I got a tentative offer for a federal job... It's with an agency I actually have an interest in working for. I have no idea how long the background check process (it's a public trust) is going to take since I got an offer for a DOD job closer to home several months ago requiring a secret clearance and I was told I wouldn't be getting an interim for that job, so I needed to sit tight. 

However, I've lived nowhere else besides Boston my entire life. It might take months before I get a full offer, or I could get it pretty soon. I'm kind of anxious since I don't really know anyone in DC and have never even visited the city but I suppose I can always start over since I'm just 27. I will definitely miss my friends here in Boston if I moved though, but I guess I can always go home and visit every so often. 

However, the opportunity is too good to toss up and I'm certain I can negotiate the salary a little bit since it's a Congressional agency and they are not on the GS scale.

DCDUI,yc2zr,66,Charged with a DUI last night. What should I do?,"My friend was going through some quarter-life crisis type stuff last night and wanted to drown his tears in some beer.  We went out on U St and got drunk (I wasn't messy like him, but I drank).  I sobered up a little at his place, til I felt comfortable to drive home (to Kalorama from Mt Pleasant, very short drive).  

Driving home, I squeaked through I yellow-turning-red, and an unmarked car pulled me over.  He asked if I had drank that night, I told him ""ya, a couple drinks"".  He got me out of the car, and passed me off to an MPD officer.  The MPD officer did the field sobriety test, which I did.  He said that, though I wasn't impaired, he could smell alcohol on me, and so took me into the station. 

In the station, I ""refused"" to consent to a urine test, and they put me in a cell to sleep it off.  I didn't think about it at the time, but refusing the test obviously carries implications.  

So basically, has anyone had a DUI charge? Should I get a lawyer?  I've never been pulled over, let alone spent the night in a police station.  

Kind of freaking out about this, because I'm living paycheck to paycheck atm, and lawyers are expensive.

TLDR; I'm a dumbass because I drove after drinking and am charged with DUI refusal. what should I do?

Lesnaya_Grud,5kr99u,29,Looking for an LGBT-friendly doctor in the Capitol Hill/Eastern Market area,"Hey Washingtonians,

I know there are several 'seeking doctor recommendation' posts on this subreddit already, but I thought mine would be specific enough to warrant a new post.

Title says it all. I'm new to the area and seeking a primary care provider (can be family, internal, etc. I don't mind too much) who is LGBT friendly. The doctor doesn't need to be LGBT themselves or specialize in LGBT care or anything, but it would nice to have a doctor who I know is open and accepting - a personal recommendation from an LGBT redditor will do just fine.

I'd prefer a male doctor within a ~30 minute walking distance to my home. Eastern Market/Capitol Hill/Union Station are all OK.

I've heard great things about OneMedical, only my insurance won't cover their $200/year membership fee. Bastards. There's a Whitman-Walker location 5 seconds from my house but they only do community, not medical, stuff at that location.

And I already looked at the [GLMA](http://www.glma.org/) site and didn't see anything too close to me that seemed like a good fit.

bennybark,c8qs61,21,Help me pick unique eats for me and my dad’s trip!,"A little backstory... my [24f] dad [61M] is a history buff and loves American history (we are Canadian) — hence the DC trip. We’re headed down to DC, just the two of us, for a week in October/November. My mom is not an adventurous eater, is happy to just have cheap and familiar food on vacation so usually they stick to chains (I know...). I am a food lover, and probably spend 70% of my time planning for a trip thinking about where to eat. My dad is excited for this new element of travel, and I want to make sure he has unique food experiences! 

This is where you come in! I’d like to try to go to at least one... “fancy”, Ethiopian, dim sum/ ramen, and “American”. I’d also like to show him some cool bars (bonus if they’re historical). I have some ideas below: please critique and add on! Obviously we’re not going to get to all these places so let me know what the best is. We don’t have a massive budget so places like minibar are out of the question. Downtown walkable is preferable. 

“Fancy”: Poca Madre, Le Dimplomate (struggling with this one, I’m a cheap eats gal)

Dim sum/ ramen: China boy, Diakaya, JINYA, Da Hong Poa

Ethiopian: chercher, Latena

American: Ted’s Bulletin, Red Hen 

Bar: Martin’s Tavern, off the record, Round Robin, Jack Rose 

What am I missing? What should I consider? Did I pick something too touristy? 

Also looking for coffee places, cheap lunches. 

TL;DR What are great DC eats to impress a 61 y/o non-foodie?

I am looking for somewhere that is pet friendly, close-commute time, and in a generally safe neighborhood with decent schools.
I do not own a vehicle and will be utilizing the metro, biking, and walking.

I have looked into Columbia Crossing Apartments and Reserve at Potomac Yard Apartments, does anyone have any experiences with these complexes?

drivingmadness45,2ob715,105,"Maryland Drivers, WTF!?","[throwaway Rant]


I have lived in the DC area for about five years and have commuted via Metro or bus with a relatively good experience. So now I have a new job where I have to take my car and commute into Maryland everyday.

Holy shit! For the past two months I cannot count to number of times I have nearly died or gotten into an accident by crazy stressed out Maryland drivers. I have almost been forced off the road by people speeding from behind then weaving into my lane right in front of me. Turn signals aren't even an option, they are just a notice that I have already moved into your lane already. Trailer trucks will go 80mph on the Beltway, so you have to go nearly 90 just so you can enter the highway, you can't slow down of course because there is someone tailgating you five feet away. 

BTW, yellow lights just mean speed speed speed. I am not a perfect driver myself, but I am a defensive driver, The one thing I have learned is if you want to get anywhere a yellow light just means press gas or else the car behind you will plow into your trunk.

Seriously, what the utter fuck is wrong with Maryland drivers? I haven't had nearly this many life-threatening situations with Virginia or DC drivers. I have had these experiences all the way from Bethesda, Langley Park, Silver Spring, Columbia, Rockville, and College Park. So it isn't a socio-economic thing.



I am desperately looking for a new job. I will take all my complaints about Metro, the slowness of trains, the crowdidness, the maintanence issues. All is fine, I know I have never had to worry about my life being in danger.

You'll get connected into a text group chat with other activists to be notified when organized protests within driving distance of DC are being planned, be able to join carpools and to get ground reports from people at various protests.

This is a group that is ONLY designed to discuss logistics, no discussion or you will be removed.

Two ways to join:
a) PM me your number
or
b) Click on the link below

(When you join this conversation you will probably want to mute new notifications so you aren't getting alerted everytime someone says something. Open the thread in question and tap on details. A menu with settings for this chat session appears. The last feature is called Do Not Disturb. Turn it on and all alerts are muted.

hood_pog,6ehdyj,13,Prince of Petworth posts possibly false story about gang of teenagers attacking woman and censors comments questioning veracity,"(Reposting this with a more accurate title) 
Another day, another example of PoP posting wild stories ""people email to him"" to get website hits.

I read this and posted to express my doubts, considering:

•	I checked the MPD twitter feed for the past two tuesdays and found nothing about this. If the police officer told her they had been chasing this group who was attacking people around all afternoon, there definitely would have been a lookout posted.

•	Also, if someone is being attacked and punched in the head by a group of 6-8 people, there is no way they are going to fight them off with a swing of an umbrella. Unless you're a superhero in a marvel movie, if you get punched in the head you're falling to the ground, and you're not going to be able to get up until the group stops attacking you.

I posted this, and asked if he had done anything to confirm whether this story was true or not (it should be pretty easy to do) and he censored my comment. That pissed me off so I'm posting it here. There is enough real crime that happens in this city to write about. Stop posting fake stuff.

After calling 911, I head out side. Of course everyone know who shot the victim... “it was stupid, they had an argument, he was only shot in the leg, he’ll be alright”. 

Well I never thought I would check the box of [person shot on street, 100 ft from my front door]. But tonight that box got CHECKED.

Gorm_the_Old,325jri,26,Moving into DC? Keep your nose open for secondhand pot smoke before signing a lease,"I'm moving out of my current apartment, but already feeling absolutely terrible for whoever makes the mistake of moving in after me.

The problem is a simple one:  my current apartment absolutely reeks of weed from the secondhand pot smoke coming up through the radiator.  I have allergies and I've had to contend with secondhand tobacco smoke before, but the current stench is indescribable, it's like nothing I've ever dealt with before.

I originally thought it was just my apartment due to my downstairs neighbors, but I'm now actually smelling the same thing on several floors in my building, and I have friends who have reported that they are getting a lot of pot odor in their buildings as well, though probably not as severe as in my building.

My sense is that most apartment building managers did not anticipate this as an issue and are not prepared to deal with it.  I called maintenance, but after tinkering a little with the filter in the radiator to little effect, they said there was very little they could do based on the building's design that lets air flow between units.

My worry is that the building management will open the windows and air the unit out while they're showing it to prospective tenants, and the new tenants won't realize how bad it is until the weather is such that they close the windows and turn on the air conditioning and get knocked out by the stench.  And I don't think my apartment is the only one where this is a potential issue.

**TL;DR:** If you're considering renting in DC, you may want to take a close sniff of the air coming out of the air conditioning unit, and may also want to ask about air flow between units.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/325jri/moving_into_dc_keep_your_nose_open_for_secondhand/,washingtondc,1428723058,/r/washingtondc/comments/325jri/moving_into_dc_keep_your_nose_open_for_secondhand/,10-04-2015 23:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/325jri/moving_into_dc_keep_your_nose_open_for_secondhand/

Smapdi1998,bruj55,17,Don't Touch Anything,"Hello, I'm a long time lurker with an anecdote that some of you may (unfortunately )  be able to identify with.

&#x200B;

I rode the metro from L'Enfant Plaza\* to Largo Town Center a while ago. When I boarded, the car was mostly full, but as we progressed it began to empty, as it was late in the evening. Nothing untoward happening, just commuters heading home. 

&#x200B;

Then a crazy person boarded. A standard issue American urban insane person. Maybe drugs, maybe head injury, maybe genetics, who knows? Nobody reacted or cared, because this was DC, and public transportation in DC. As soon as the train began to move, the man began to march down the aisle and lick the upright hand-hold poles in the center of the car. Bottom to top, half-step to the left, start again, bottom to top. Nice and slow, so as to avoid leaving any of the surface area in a non-licked state. He didn't make weird noises, he didn't threaten anyone or take his junk out of his pants or rant, he just coated each handrail in his saliva with methodical dedication. When he was finished, he exited the train - I can't recall which stop, but it wasn't LTC - presumably to board the next unsuspecting train and begin again. It's good to have a hobby i suppose.

&#x200B;

Many of the riders spoke up, yelled at him, looked at each other and said ""Can you believe this?"" as soon as they realized what was happening. He didn't notice. Riders did everything they could, short of tackling the guy. Nobody tackled him, because he was filthy and insane, and to tackle a filthy insane person riding public trans in the middle of their insanity-habit is a one way ticket to hepatitis-town. 

&#x200B;

After he exited, the riders took care to warn anyone who boarded about the handholds, but eventually those of us who saw it happen reached our own stops. Nobody made little signs to warn newcomers and I'm certain some perfectly nice innocent people got insane-man drippings on themselves that night. 

&#x200B;

Hooray for society

ThrowawayDC1234,4it8og,47,Broke up with girlfriend need to know what to expect about dating.,"Obvious throwaway. 

Moved here a year ago with my girlfriend but we broke up a few days ago. Kind of concerned about the whole dating thing here in the city since it is so transient.  

Is it reasonable to assume that it is particularly difficult to date someone, find love, get married, etc here compared to another city?   

What about dating apps like tinder? Are these more so for just meeting up to have sex and end the relationship there? 

Im in my early 30s, average looking guy, average to slightly out of shape but by no means fat. I'm probably a 7 on looks. I have a respectable job and a good education. Basically, am I going to be depressed and lonely here?   

Also, I should probably dress nice for these dates. Can anyone recommend a good tailor? (Just a little humor to help me through this) 

Edit: wow! I really didn't expect that many responses. Thank you so much for all the insight.

triathlete94,3s4p35,59,Advice: living alone or with a roommate,"Hi all,

X post here from r/personalfinance...

I'll be graduating college this May and was fortunate enough to land a consulting gig in DC. So, my question is whether I should live alone or with a roommate.

A couple of things to note:

--I will be traveling Monday through Thursday every week. So I'll only have 4 nights at home per week.

--I've had roommates for the past 4 years at college and throughout my summers too. I usually get along with most of them, but I keep sort of a weird schedule. I'm into triathlon and am up early to train and consequently go to bed quite early. There have been many a scuffle over how loud the TV should be past 9 or 10pm.

--on a similar note, I have something like 5k invested in my bikes. I'm not really comfortable with the fact that they will be sitting there 4 days a week without me there. Meanwhile my roommate can have randos over during that time. I don't want to have to be thinking about my stuff when I'm traveling for work

--I do have a SO and they will be in DC with me. We will be living separately, but privacy is always nice when she comes over :D

--I'll be making 75k a year base, anywhere from 10-20k bonus

In my mind, the only positive for a roommate is the cheaper cost. It looks like I'll be lucky to find a studio for 1500/month in DC, and that's already a little over 35% of my salary. I've always been rather frugal, so I'm confident I can still save money even if I do pay 1500+ in rent, but obviously cheaper rent is always nice.

Living with the SO is not an option. I suppose I could try to find another consultant to be a roommate?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3s4p35/advice_living_alone_or_with_a_roommate/,washingtondc,1447104096,/r/washingtondc/comments/3s4p35/advice_living_alone_or_with_a_roommate/,09-11-2015 16:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3s4p35/advice_living_alone_or_with_a_roommate/

I need to move all my stuff from Adams Morgan to Brookland tomorrow. My roommate is helping with his SUV, but I have some stuff (ie my bed) that would probably fit better in a flat bed truck. Should take 2-3 hours and I'll pay you $40 for helping.

,52kwj5,10,March in DC at White House today 12-4pm against the DEA's emergency schedule of kratom,"Come show support! Yet again the DEA is banning another harmless herb just like marijuana. When has prohibition EVER worked? It didnt work for alcohol and sure as hell didnt work for marijuana.

Kratom has been used for thousands upon thousands of years and has 0 deaths contributed to kratom alone. Cigarettes and alcohol combined are some of the highest leading cause of death in the US! The DEA quotes ~650 posion control calls due to kratom from 2014-2016 to justify the ban, yet laundry detergent packet calls to posion control were over 16,000+!  

It helps opioid addicts get off the junk, helps with anxiety and depression, and other ailments but the DEA says it has no medical value. There have been hundreds of testimonials from young, middle aged and SENIORS experiences with this natural wonder herb related to the coffee plant. 

This will only make the opioid epidemic WORSE in the long run banning this substance. It sounds horrible, but people using a natural plant as an *alternative* to synthetic prescription drugs and heroin is a GOOD thing!!!!! Opioid overdoses went up in Alabama when they banned kratom!

I hope *somebody* does more research after reading this and comes out to show support.

They still have not come up with a solution or how to get my money back.

Went online again today and saw that my card had been cloned again. WMATA is saying it's impossible to clone metro cards which I disagree with since I think it can be done with illegal RFID scanners. So frustrated. The bus is really the only feasible way for me to get to work.

Yet in this progressive day in age it seems like we have no problems with second hand weed and when people smoke it out in public near the metro, at concerts or at city festivals.  The argument back in the 90s before cigarette smoking bans in restaurants and outside buildings existed was that non-smokers had the inherent right to not have their lungs polluted by your choice to smoke cigarettes.  So why doesn't that same argument apply to weed?  Yes, cigs cause cancer, but weed is also a psychotropic.  Why don't non-smokers' rights to have clean air and not to have secondary exposure to a mind altering drug trump your right to smoke weed out in public?

ImpressiveRole1111,a3jbso,13,Aggressive Panhandlers/Potential Mugging?,"So I was in McDonalds in Woodley Park at the Metro Station at 6:30.  I've had a long day and am eating a dollar menu burger.  A guy wanders in, it is 32 out, pants literally down to his waist(???).  He is aggressively harassing people in the restaurant for ""spare dollars"", I just shrugged and kept eating, as did the other people.

So I finish, leave, and walk out.  I needed to go to the bathroom and there are none nearby, so before I went down into the metro, I circled back to the back entrance of the Mcdonalds, and find the bathroom.  There is a weird twisty lock thing on the door, and it seemed like someone was following me as I was headed there.

I heard someone trying a bunch to open the door of the thing, and it almost sounded like an employee was trying to fidget with it or something, I figured it was an employee trying to kick me out of the bathroom or something.  

I finish at the urinal, and it is the same guy-blocking the door.  He starts like speaking to me and addressing me again, and refuses to budge.  I bolt out and scoot past him barely on the side, and he starts yelling that I am ""nasty and dirty and needed to come back in and wash my hands"".

I bolted and wasn't going to be lured back in, but his behavior really creeped me out, and I was wondering if anyone else has had close calls in the DC area before.

I was at the Starbucks right on dupont today and there were two homeless guys throwing punches at each other outside of the store and they were wearing hats, and there were two junkies inside who were wearing full winter gear and shivering upstairs even though they had like a gratuitous amount of clothes on and had been inside for like 30 minutes.  Probably like 25% of the people in there were homeless.

IBEWelectrician,9idp04,47,Where to move when Job City varies?,"Sorry for the wall of text, I am on mobile. 

I am an union electrician in the metropolitan zone. I am looking to move to the area (DMV) within the next few weeks. My yearly income will be about $57,000 (only for 1 year as I will be getting yearly pay raises til I cap out at $95,000 without any overtime.) Off of 40 hour work weeks but I'm sure I will get a lot of overtime but I'm trying to budget off of 40 hour work weeks. (Insurance and pension is fully funded by employer so I can spend full after tax on living expenses.)

Rent: $1,200 - $1,500 but flexible.

I was told my job site can be anywhere in District of Columbia

Maryland: Calvert, Charles, Montgomery, Prince George’s, and St. Mary’s Counties.

Virginia: Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, King George, Loudoun, Prince William, Stafford, and Westmoreland Counties, also the City of Fredericksburg (in Spotsylvania County).

If I could find an apartment in the middle of this area.

I have a family. Me,my wife and our two children (both under the age of 3). We can all share a bedroom. So I am looking for a 1-2 bedroom for us. Wife stays at home so I am not worried about daycare or school systems for the next 2-3 years.

I have a car but plan to mostly bike and metro to work when I am able to.

I do have a couple guns I would like to bring with me. 9mm and ar-15. But I am flexible on getting rid of them if need be. I understand that i am moving from a gun happy state (Georgia) to a not so gun friendly area.

I plan to stay in an extended stay or airbnb for about a month until I figure out where to live, but looking for recommendations.

Also, what are some unexpected costs that come with living in the area that arent seen in the south? (Tolls, parking passes, metro costs, etc.)

Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.

I'm here for a limited time so growing it is not a viable option,  but I understand that I can be gifted as much as an ounce by any kind soul willing to share. I have a valid over 21 ID.

The law makes it to where it appears I am asking for a handout, but I am definitely not looking to leave my new sharing friend without a nice meal or a new Xbox game or some sort of way to say thank you, if you catch my drift. Also I'd love to just legally burn with someone for the first time as well.

My final question is are their any private clubs that allow for the use of recreational cannabis or is it only in a private residence that the law allows for?

CrushRush,qjhe3,15,"r/Washingtondc, It is time to organize. Let's get Rush Limbaugh out of our nation's capital.","The key is to put on the pressure through the local advertisers.

There are very few local advertising availabilities on The Rush Limbaugh Show and they sell at a premium. Below is a list of companies that advertised on The Rush Limbaugh Show on WMAL AM 360 (Washington, D.C.) on March 5, 2012.  Here's what to do:


1. Call the advertiser, be polite.
2. Write a letter to the advertiser, be polite.
3. Copy the station and the FCC with the advertiser letter.
4. Politely call the General Manager of the station,tell the GM what you are doing and why, tell them you have contacted the advertiser and copied the FCC.
5. If the local advertiser uses an agency, contact the agency, as well. Just ask the local business, if they use an agency.

It won’t take many letters and phone calls to get their attention and remind the station that the letters need to be placed in the station’s public file. (the public file is an FCC requirement)

Local stations don’t get many local avails in Rush’s show and many pay a huge fee to Premiere to run the show.  If they start losing business, they will raise hell with Premiere.

Rielos,psnx5,9,Gold's Gym Sucks! (aka What a Customer-exploiting Business Model Looks Like),"I wanted to share my experience with Gold's Gym here in DC (and I suspect nationwide) in the hope that it might save some others the trouble.

I signed up for a government employee rate (~$19 bi-weekly) at the Gold's Federal Center Southwest location in February of 2011.  Apparently there is a one year commitment attached to signing up which I vaguely remember but had no reason to be concerned as my job appeared stable at the time.

I left that job in that location in September of 2011 and moved to another one in another location here in DC in November with no easy ability to commute to the Gold's location.  It simply wasn't worth the 40-minute one way commute to workout for an hour.  So I found a new gym near the new job.

I called the local location to cancel my membership in October of 2011 and was told I needed to ""come in person and sign the cancellation request"".  I refused to do that and requested recourse.  They suggested calling ""corporate"" and hinted that I wouldn't receive much satisfaction using that method.  

I pressed on.  After navigating a phone-tree menu that alludes to this very situation (why would you need an entire menu item devoted to ""Checking the status of a previously requested cancellation?"") and a good 30 minutes on hold I spoke to a less-than-helpful support representative.  She told me that I was locked-in to my contract which ended in February of 2012 and could not sever the agreement.   I was a little irate but conceded and asked her to cancel my membership effective as soon as the contract expired.  She agreed and ""noted"" my file.  After all, I *did* sign the agreement without thoroughly reading the fine print.

Fast forward to today, 2/17/12.  I noticed that I was billed *again* this week after what I recalled was when the contract should have expired.   I called corporate back, reached a support operator a little easier this time (<5 minute wait on the phone).  But upon investigating, my account was billed on 2/13 for full price, though my contract was ""fulfilled"" on 2/14!  What a joke.   I asked if I were to going to be billed again and the response was ""Yes, you have to request cancellation *in writing* with 30-days notice!""   This would have put me paying for two more installments (bi-weekly payments) in Feb/March and being able to use the gym through early April.  I was outraged and asked her to check my account for my previous request to cancel.  Shocker...she didn't find any record of it.

In the end I was very frustrated and demanded that the account be cancelled or I would change my billing credit card to make this stop (I had already asked my bank if there was possible).  The representative then conveniently ""waived"" the 30-day requirement and flagged my account for termination.   It remains to be seen if I'm not billed again in two weeks...

In a world of online portals with account management and with the high turnover rates of jobs/life/people in DC, I think they could stand to do a LOT better.

TL;DR **The Gold's Gym business/support model is purposefully designed to be very difficult for members to get status of their accounts and to cancel once they have joined.  I would suggest avoiding Gold's Gym at all costs.**",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/psnx5/golds_gym_sucks_aka_what_a_customerexploiting/,washingtondc,1329447841,/r/washingtondc/comments/psnx5/golds_gym_sucks_aka_what_a_customerexploiting/,16-02-2012 22:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/psnx5/golds_gym_sucks_aka_what_a_customerexploiting/

Devastator1981,4kzxot,169,Black guy here: What are the dynamics of interracial dating in DC?,"Moderator: I know ""race"" can be a red flag in front of a bull, but I'm legitimately curious about this issue. If it gets locked/negged, I'd love for anyone to reach out in direct message. If it's getting out of control feel free to delete the thread--I want it to be about interracial dating in DC specifically, not a greater discussion of race in the world. 

TLDR: There's unquestionably a bias we have to overcome. Not the end of the world, but any perspectives to add to this? Is it a matter of the scene in DC one is in? Why do other minorities seem even more judgmental against black people?

Here goes, first I wish many folks would stop saying ""race doesn't matter"" or just ""get over it"". Especially if people saying that are super good looking non-black minority (i.e. ""exotic"") or a white guy. You just can't relate really. 

Second, I'm not talking about any one individual or situation exclusively but general patterns. I'm sure there'll be outliers, but outliers are not the normal. 

In my experience, non-black women are not as approachable for me and many of my black male friends. This is weird as we're in DC, diplomats and melting pot and all of that and also because I'm able to be friends with both men and women from all nationalities and races. Another interesting thing is that I'd say Asian, Latina's/South Americans and Indians are almost often actually even less approachable than white women. This issue of other minorities being even as prejudiced against blacks for dating that is less talked about but just as prevalent. Read Dataclysm from Christian Mulder. He's the founder of OkCupid, he knows his stuff based on how people ACTUALLY BEHAVE, not what they say and he's found that:

>I’m no brave crusader, but race (and racism) were part of my >education. So when, in researching the book, I unpacked three >separate databases and found that in every one white people >gave black people short-shrift, I wasn’t shocked, you know? >**Asians and Latinos apply the same penalty to African Americans >that white folks do,** which says something about how even (relatively) recent additions to the “American experience” have >acquired its biases.

Yes, we all need to improve ourselves and I'm by no means a perfect human being. I've seen many Asian's won't even smile when you greet them, they'll have this really stern look and sometimes *even literally not look at you*. I've been in group dinners where I've experienced that from Asians (both south Asian i.e. Indian and from Korea, etc) . I want to think it's cultural but my boy who is white will get the deer in headlights eyes, laughs, smiles often so it's not that. On the other hand, maybe it's because I assume white women, asians, indians, etc will not give me the time of day (but it's backed up by data and experience!) and it affects how I interact with them in any way let alone ""approaching while out"" i.e. a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Anyway race is clearly an issue. More constructive than just saying ""it's not an issue"" which is putting a crossface on reality, is for a discussion on how to manage it, re-frame it, use it to our advantage of everyone, etc. ",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/4kzxot/black_guy_here_what_are_the_dynamics_of/,washingtondc,1464215727,/r/washingtondc/comments/4kzxot/black_guy_here_what_are_the_dynamics_of/,25-05-2016 18:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/4kzxot/black_guy_here_what_are_the_dynamics_of/

nastycd26,d3ais3,32,Where to live?,"Hey All,

I’m moving to DC shortly and somewhat lost on where to live. I’m a 39 y/o black gay male into the arts, sports, politics, traveling, fitness and overall healthy lifestyle. I’ll go out for dinners but generally will cook at home. I really need to live alone and wouldn’t want to pay more than $2500 +-. I’ll be making around $110,000 and will work around I NW and 13th NW.  I currently have a car, but would prefer mass transit to get around so I’m planning on selling my car.

I’m also a little worried about my social prospects as I’m “older” and won’t know anyone in the city.  Seems like most people move to DC when they’re in their 20s, 30s. I’d love to find a solid group of professional BLACK gay/straight friends as a base, but I’d also want a diverse set as well. I’m out, but I’ve never really been into the gay scene. I suspect it’s probably homonormative  in DC? Would love your thoughts on where to live and how to find my way.

YourLocalNavi,bz0pfg,22,I wrote a play about the DC Sniper.,"Hi everyone! Long time lurker, occasional poster. 

&#x200B;

I've spent the past two years writing and composing a theatrical piece about the DC area during the events of the DC Sniper (October 2002).  In the last two years, it's gone from being a weird little idea to a giant spectacle (10 person cast, full production team with live cameras, miniatures, etc). We opened on Friday and run through the month of June! 

&#x200B;

If you're interested in seeing it, [there's more information here.](http://www.pointlesstheatre.com/forest-treas) I'll also be on **The Kojo Nnamdi Show** at noon tomorrow talking about it! 

&#x200B;

The show is not a biographical account of the Sniper. It is very much about community and this area, and how the media descended/enveloped/oversaturated the events. That being said, I have definitely encountered people who were angry/shocked/disgruntled at my approaching these events thru the lens of art. It's complicated subject matter, and while I've done my best to be responsible with it, there'll always be detractors. 

&#x200B;

In order for this not to be a straight up shill post for the production, I'm curious...

&#x200B;

Were you in the area then? What do you remember about it? If you weren't, what do you remember about it? Do you feel it's an event we shouldn't be approaching through art? If so, why? 

&#x200B;

I'm totally down to answer any questions anyone might have about the show, the process of making it, and the research that went into it. Thanks for your time! 

&#x200B;

lilskr4p_Y,4unufz,17,"Concerned husband. Wife needs help getting back into Hill politics, don't know how I can help her. Can anyone here offer advice/help?","Hello all. First of all, thank you in advance for your time.
So my wife is a criminal defense attorney. She has been practicing for 4 years. She clerked for a Circuit Court Judge, then transitioned to an extremely reputable private firm where she works on huge trials. She is great at her job.

Before the clerkship, she was briefly in state politics for a year, and was even BETTER at that. She worked for a state senator and personally had bills passed that no one thought were possible. 

After practicing for 4 years, she now really feels like politics is her true calling. Problem is once you're out of politics, it's so hard to get back in without DC hill experience. And you can't get experience without having experience on your resume, etc etc.

My wife has been trying day and night for the past 8 months to get a job in politics again. She has met with dozens of people through dozens of contacts, applied to hundreds of positions, had coffee what seems like millions of times, gotten involved in local political groups, reached out to her congressman to join his upcoming campaign, etc.

 After all this she has only gotten 2 or 3 interviews. The people she meets with tell her that she has an incredible resume, and that she is extremely hirable, but still no results. After 8 months. She has made the final round of people after 8 interviews on two occasions, but someone else was chosen.

She is starting to get extremely (and understandably) discouraged and depressed. I try to give her encouragement and advice, but honestly this is not my realm. It kills me to see her this discouraged because I love her so much, and she is objectively so talented and smart.

I was wondering if you had any advice for her, especially on how to get her foot into the door in politics or policy work. Thank you all again, and let me know if you need any more info.

cafecoffee,43lbat,48,Moving to DC - advice on neighborhoods?,"Hi /r/washingtondc! 
I'm currently living in Chicago, and looking to move to DC in the coming months. I've done a bunch of reading on this subreddit, including the moving to DC wiki post; I also looked at padmapper and a few other sites to see what I can get within my budget. All that said, I'm still a bit confused about neighborhoods and where to focus my search. 

I am looking to rent a decent-sized one bedroom and would prefer not to pay more than $2,000 a month. I'd love any ideas y'all have on which neighborhoods I should look at! 

Some things that would be good to have in the new apartment/neighborhood:

* Safety - I'd like to feel comfortable walking home at night
* Stuff to do/eat/drink in the area - don't need a million options but just options would be great
* Reasonable commute - my office will be near Dupont Circle so walking there or being somewhere metro-friendly would be great!
* Amenities: Would be nice to have in-unit dishwasher, in-building washer/dryer, and a gym. A doorman would be nice as well. (I have no clue if I can get any of this in my budget or if I'll need to increase it a bit.) 

Any ideas? 

PS In case it helps, for those of y'all that know Chicago, I've lived in River North, Lakeview and liked both.

winterswrath7,9r2v2t,41,"Bike Cops pull guy on bike over for going wrong way down the street, proceed to cross busy intersection while light is red. Shaking my head.","At 12th and F street NE, intersection with Maryland. Black guy on bike is going the wrong way down F. Four bike cops pull him over and then surround him, blocking him in with their bikes. One of these guys I see all the time. I call him Smokey because he apparently is always smoking a cigar. They also call a squad car. The guy that got pulled over gets his phone out to record the stop.

I stood by watching cause the situation was clearly intimidating. 

I guess they wrote him a ticket and then went on their way. They all cross Maryland, a very busy street, while the light was red, which I pointed out to them. They seemed oblivious to the fact and to the irony. 

F street is also only a one way on the block north and the block south of Maryland ave, so the fact that he was going the wrong way was purely technical. 

If you’re going to be pulling people over for violating traffic laws, you should be the number one model of following those laws.

MARKUSofDC,dshjhf,38,Scootering/Walking to Reagan National Airport?,"I am currently living a 3-5 minute drive from DCA airport and find it really annoying that Uber/Lyft rides cost $10-12 to go this tiny distance. 

Walking would take me 40 minutes according to Google Maps, but I believe there are unmapped shortcuts to get on the Mount Vernon bike trail that would significantly shorten the trip for me. I wouldn't mind walking if I'm able to find a shortcut that would shorten the walk to 20 minutes or less. I would depart from either Crystal City, Potomac Yard, or my house facing the Mount Vernon trail.

I recently got the idea to rent an electric scooter and ride along the Mount Vernon Trail. The trip would cost me about $3, and I'd be able to get to the airport in 8 minutes.

moss-fete,csbp40,9,Commuting to Gaithersburg by bike/transit: reasonable? Where to live en route?,"Hi! I'm sorry to tell you that this is a ""moving-to"" thread, so if there's a better place to put this please direct me to it. 

With that said, I'm a recent college grad from Portland, OR, in the process of moving to the area for a job in Gaithersburg. The job itself is basically the best I could hope for at this point in my life, so I'm very excited about that part. Unfortunately, what I've seen of the Maryland suburbs so far is god-forsaken suburbia, which is pretty much the exact thing I don't want to live in. So, I have a few questions:

First, are there nice parts of the Maryland suburbs that I've just happened to miss so far? By ""Nice"", I mean basically anything not strip-malls and 8-lane roads the whole way down. I don't need to be in an exciting happening area, just anything that's not identical McMansions, chain ""fast casual"" restaurants, and impossible to go anywhere without getting into a car. (I'm sorry if this is coming across as bitter or aggressive, I mean nothing against people who live in suburbs, but it's not particularly a life I want, especially in my early 20s.)

If not, getting to the question from my title: Would it be reasonable to live in the NW parts of DC proper, near the Red Line, and commute to Gaithersburg by taking the Red Line to its end, and bus or bicycle from there? 

If so, are there particular neighborhoods along the Red Line I should be looking at for that? A quiet, residential area is fine by me - I don't need to be in the center of an exciting area, in fact I'd rather not be. I'd want a calm, not completely car-dominated neighborhood where I can go to grocery stores, coffeeshops, that kind of thing walking or biking. Ideally I'd love somewhere where I can rent a room in a shared house with other people of a similar age/point in life. 

Is that a reasonable plan? Do places like that exist?

bike19999999,cbxlzc,35,Dulles Access Road,"Hi guys,

I wonder if anyone has been doing this?

So this morning I was driving from DC to Herndon for work, I know, my commute sucks. 

Anyways, when I got onto 267 from 66 west bound I did not make it to the right lanes in time before the divider so I was in Dulles access road instead, and I could not get back to the toll road. I was like crap now I have to waste the 15 min I saved by paying toll. But then I realized the access road doesn't have tolls! I followed the GPS and got to work for only 7 min longer than usual.

So I wondered if anyone is doing this on a daily basis?

I saw some very old posts from 2012 that people got tickets for this, what is the situation now?

BTW I saw one cop on the access road when I got close to the airport looking through some telescopes at the access road while standing next to his car. I wonder if that is how they enforce the backtracking thing.

Any ideas?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/cbxlzc/dulles_access_road/,washingtondc,1562890876,/r/washingtondc/comments/cbxlzc/dulles_access_road/,11-07-2019 20:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/cbxlzc/dulles_access_road/

Also, do any of the schools let the public use their tracks? That’s ubiquitous in Boston, my hometown, but entirely nonexistent here in ATL.
