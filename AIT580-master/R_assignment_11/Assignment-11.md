- The graph named 'Washington DC population structure' shows the population of male and female of different ages in terms of percentage. 

**PROBLEM**
- Here, a proper comparision of percentage of population of male and female could not be made as the male population is on one side and female population is on other side.
- Percentage is used to describe the count of population but without providing the total population of male and female, this representation is meaning less.
- Even the name  'population pyramid' is also not apt for a bar graph.

**SOLUTION**
- Male population and the female population can be taken on a single axis with the same scale for having a proper comparison between them.
- Instead of percentage of population, the count of population can be used or the total population can be shown in the legend and use percentage of population.
- A proper name can be given instead of 'pyramid'.

**b) Find one example of misleading interpretation, explain the problem and suggest a solution ?**

- The graph named 'Number of Overdose Deaths' describes the deaths caused due to the overdose of different drugs in different years.

**PROBLEM**
- In the above graph the bars which are used for the count of deaths and corresponding comparision of count for different drugs is clumsy as too much data is invovled in the graph.
-Proper comparision of different plots cannot be made as the scatter plot is combined with the bar plot and comparision of bar plot with scatter plot is not correct.

**SOLUTION**
- A stacked histogram can be used where the total count is described by the bar and count of deaths for different drugs can be stacked in the bar and plotted for different years.
- Another bar plot which represents the comparison of deaths caused by different drugs can be made, where a line plot or 3 bars describing counts of deaths for Rx Opioids, Synthetic Opioids, Heroin can be made for different years.
